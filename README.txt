# Lexical-Analyzer
A lexical analyzer for the programming language PL/0. Your program must be capable to read in a source program written in PL/0, identify some errors, and produce, as output, the source program lexeme table and a list of lexemes. 

Once you have navigated to the directory where the vm.c file is, type:
              gcc vm.c
to compile it, then type:
              ./a.out test1.txt
to run it. You can also replace the .txt file with whatever input file you'd like.
